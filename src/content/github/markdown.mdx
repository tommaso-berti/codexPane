# Markdown

## Headings

Setext-style (underline):

~~~
Title of My Document
====================

Sub-Title of My Document
------------------------
~~~

ATX-style (hashes):

~~~
# Title of My Document
~~~

**Tip**: Prefer a single `#` for the page title and `##` for subsections in GitHub READMEs.

## Lists

Ordered list example:

~~~
My Todo List
============

At the end of this **week**, I plan to:

1. Learn Markdown
2. Write Markdown
3. Share a Markdown note
~~~

## Blockquotes

Quotes are introduced with `>`:

~~~
My favorite quote is:
> If you didn't get it the first time
> Do not despair
> Try and try again
> ~ Anonymous
~~~

Renders as:

> If you didn't get it the first time
> Do not despair
> Try and try again
> ~ Anonymous

## Inline emphasis

- **Bold**: `**text**`
- *Italic*: `*text*`
- `code`: `` `inline` ``

## Html in markdown

Markdown can be mixed with raw HTML when needed:

~~~
<h1>My Todo List</h1>
<p>At the end of this <strong>week</strong>, I plan to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Learn Markdown</li>
  <li>Write Markdown</li>
  <li>Share a Markdown note</li>
</ol>
<p>My favorite quote is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    If you didn't get it the first time<br>
    Do not despair<br>
    Try and try again<br>
    ~ Anonymous
  </p>
</blockquote>
~~~

**Note**: GitHub’s renderer sanitizes unsafe HTML for security.

## File extensions

Contrary to popular belief, Markdown is not a document format and does not require a specific file extension. Any text extension (for example, `.txt`) works. However, platforms like GitHub **prefer** `.md` or `.markdown` for automatic rendering.

## Parsers and tools

A *Markdown parser* converts Markdown to HTML. The original parser was in Perl, and today there are implementations in most languages. Core syntax commonly supported: paragraphs, headings, blockquotes, emphasis, lists, code, images, and links.

Popular web editors/converters include: **StackEdit.io**, **Dillinger**, **Parse**, and **Markdown to HTML Converter**. Some tools also output raw HTML for copy-paste into other contexts.

## Readme essentials

Your README should communicate purpose and usage clearly. Include:

- **Project title**: the name of your project.
- **Description**: why you built it; what problems it solves; what you learned.
- **Features**: highlight unique capabilities; add screenshots or GIFs.
- **How to use**: install and run steps; list prerequisites.
- **Technologies**: frameworks, libraries, and why you chose them.
- **Collaborators**: names and links to their GitHub profiles.
- **License**: clarify what others can do with your code.

**Attention**: Keep READMEs brief but detailed, always up to date, and easy to scan—use headings, lists, and visuals.
