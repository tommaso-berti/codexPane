# Commit guidelines

Short, consistent commit messages make history easier to read, search and automate. Use the prefixes below to categorize changes and keep subjects in the imperative mood (e.g., *add*, *fix*, *refactor*).

> **Tip**: Keep the subject under ~72 characters. Add details in the body when needed.

## Prefix

Use one of these prefixes at the start of the subject (or as a branch-style tag), followed by a brief description.

| Prefix     | Usage                                             | Example                       |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `feature/` | New functionality or section                      | `feature/14-search-component` |
| `fix/`     | Bug fix or regression                             | `fix/22-docmenu-anchor`       |
| `refactor/`| Code improvement without behavior change          | `refactor/19-hooks-cleanup`   |
| `docs/`    | Documentation, README, comments                   | `docs/20-update-install-guide`|
| `chore/`   | Minor tasks or maintenance (deps, build, lint)    | *(no number)*                 |

> **Note**: If you track work with issues or tickets, include the number right after the prefix (e.g., `feature/14-...`, `fix/22-...`).

## Usage

- **Format**:
~~~
<prefix><optional-issue-id>-<short-kebab-slug>: <concise imperative subject>
  ~~~
Examples of subjects: `add autocomplete to search`, `fix anchor scrolling in doc menu`.

- **Body (optional)**: Add context, rationale, or references on a new line after a blank line.
~~~
Why:
- Anchor links were not preserved on navigation
- Regression after sidebar refactor

References: #22
  ~~~

- **Scope (optional)**: You can include an additional scope between the prefix and slug if helpful.
~~~
feature/14-ui-search: add debounce to input
fix/22-docs-nav: preserve hash on route change
  ~~~

> **Attention**: Avoid vague subjects like “updates” or “minor fixes”. Prefer explicit actions and affected areas.
