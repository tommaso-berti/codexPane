# Introduction to GitHub

GitHub is a cloud platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on code. It layers team workflows—issues, pull requests, code review, discussions—on top of Git so individuals and organizations can build software together efficiently and transparently.

At its core, a **repository** stores your project’s files and history. You’ll typically work on **branches** to isolate changes, then open a **pull request (PR)** to propose merging those changes into a main line. PRs enable **code review**, **status checks** (tests/linters), and threaded conversations that document decisions.

Beyond version control, GitHub provides:

- **Issues & Projects**: Track bugs, features, and tasks; plan work with boards, backlogs, and roadmaps.
- **Actions (CI/CD)**: Automate testing, builds, releases, and workflows using YAML-based pipelines that run on every push or PR.
- **Packages & Container Registry**: Publish and consume packages and container images alongside your code.
- **Security**: Dependabot alerts and updates, secret scanning, code scanning (SARIF), and security advisories to harden your supply chain.
- **Wikis & Discussions**: Capture knowledge and enable community Q&A.
- **Codespaces & Web Editor**: Spin up dev environments in the cloud with one click, or edit directly in the browser.
- **GitHub CLI & API**: Script, integrate, and customize workflows from the terminal or programmatically.

Typical day-to-day flow:

1. **Fork or clone** a repo.
2. **Create a branch**, commit changes with clear messages.
3. **Open a PR**; ensure checks pass; request reviews.
4. **Discuss & iterate**; squash or merge when ready.
5. **Tag releases** and publish artifacts; monitor issues and automate with Actions.

**Tip**: Keep branches small and focused, write descriptive PR titles/bodies, and require reviews and checks on protected branches for a healthier codebase.

In the following sections, we’ll dive into practical workflows, branching strategies, PR etiquette, Actions recipes, and security best practices so you can use GitHub effectively in solo and team settings.
