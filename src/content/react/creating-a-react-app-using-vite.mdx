# Creating a React App Using Vite

## Getting ready
We’ve previously recommended using **create-react-app (CRA)** to bootstrap a React project. Since then, the React team has sunset this tool. This lesson focuses on **Vite** (pronounced “veet”), the modern build tool that has become the preferred non-framework lightweight solution for React development.

You’ll need **Node v18+ or v20+**. Even if you installed Node recently, it’s a good idea to update **npm**, which ships with Node but updates more frequently:

~~~bash
sudo npm install -g npm@latest
~~~

> **Tip:** On Windows PowerShell, drop `sudo`:
> ~~~powershell
> npm install -g npm@latest
> ~~~

## Setting up the boilerplate application
Using a build tool like Vite lets you quickly generate a boilerplate React app with the necessary configuration.

**Why Vite?**
- A consistent project structure you’ll recognize across projects
- An optimized build process out of the box
- A fast dev server with hot module replacement (HMR)
- Modern tooling with minimal configuration

Create a new Vite project using npm’s `create` command (runs the package without installing globally):

~~~bash
npm create vite@latest
~~~

Follow the interactive prompts:
- Enter your project name (e.g., `my-react-app`)
- Select **React** as the framework
- Choose **JavaScript** or **TypeScript** as the variant

You can also pass options directly:

~~~bash
# npm
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
~~~

Per creare la struttura React dentro a una cartella già esistente si può usare:
~~~bash
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
~~~
> **Note:** The line above is in Italian as provided by the original notes. English: “To create the React structure inside an existing folder you can use …”.

Then `cd` into your project, install dependencies, and start the dev server:

~~~bash
cd my-react-app
npm install
npm run dev
~~~

> **Tip:** You can use `yarn` or `pnpm` instead of `npm` if you prefer. Replace the install/run commands accordingly.

## Recap
Interactive prompt summary (as shown by `create-vite`):

~~~
npx
create-vite

│
◇ Project name:
│ my-react-app
│
◇ Select a framework:
│ React
│
◇ Select a variant:
│ JavaScript
│
◇ Scaffolding project in /Users/codecademy/Desktop/vite/my-react-app...
│
└ Done. Now run:

cd my-react-app
npm install
npm run dev
~~~

## React app structure
After scaffolding, you’ll see a structure like:

~~~
└── 📁my-react-app
├── 📁public
│ └── vite.svg
├── 📁src
│ ├── App.css
│ ├── App.jsx
│ ├── 📁assets
│ │ └── react.svg
│ ├── index.css
│ └── main.jsx
├── .gitignore
├── eslint.config.js
├── index.html
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── vite.config.js
~~~

Vite uses a modern build system that transforms these files into optimized static assets. Visitors are served those static assets.

## Key directories
**/node_modules**
All dependencies and sub-dependencies specified in `package.json`. You don’t edit this folder directly; it’s in `.gitignore`.

**/public**
Static assets served directly without processing. Copied to the build output during production.
- `vite.svg` — Vite logo (replace with your favicon if you like).

**/src**
Your application code:
- `/assets` — images and other assets that Vite can process
- `App.jsx` — main React component
- `App.css` — styles for `App`
- `main.jsx` — app entry point (like `index.js`/`index.jsx` elsewhere)
- `index.css` — global styles

> **Note:** Throughout the Learn React materials we refer to `index.jsx` as the entry file. Vite’s template uses `main.jsx` but it serves the same purpose. If you prefer to follow the lessons exactly, you can rename `main.jsx` to `index.jsx` and update the script reference in `index.html`.

## Key files
**index.html** (at project root)
The HTML entry for your app. Vite injects your JavaScript during build. Edit it to add meta tags, change the page title, or include additional scripts/styles.

**package.json**
Project settings:
- Dependencies
- Scripts for development, build, and preview
- Other metadata

Common scripts:
- `dev` — starts the dev server
- `build` — creates a production build
- `preview` — serves the production build locally

**vite.config.js**
Vite configuration (includes the React plugin by default). Extend it to add:
- Import aliases
- Custom build options
- Additional plugins
- Proxy settings for API requests

**eslint.config.js**
ESLint configuration (Vite template ships with a basic React-recommended setup).

**.gitignore**
Tells Git which paths to ignore (e.g., `node_modules`, build output, environment files).

> **Tip:** As your app grows, add a `/components` directory for reusable components and a `/views` directory for route-level pages.

## Starting the react app development server
Run:

~~~bash
npm run dev
~~~

This starts Vite’s dev server with fast HMR. Open the printed local URL in your browser.

## React devtools sandbox
**React DevTools** has an online sandbox that lets you try the basic features without installing a browser extension. Use it as a quick, hands-on way to learn component inspection, props/state viewing, and performance profiling.

> **Note:** If you have the sandbox link from your course material, keep it handy and open it alongside your running Vite app for practice.
