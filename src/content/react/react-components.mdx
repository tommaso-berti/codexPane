# React components

React applications are made of components. A component is a small, reusable chunk of code responsible for one job—often rendering some HTML and re-rendering it when data changes.

## Import react

The first React component we created in the last exercise started with importing **react**:

~~~
import React from 'react';
~~~

This creates an object named `React`, which contains methods necessary to use the React library. `react` is imported from the `'react'` package, which should be installed in your project as a dependency. With this object, we can start utilizing features of the React library!

In a React application, the `App.js` file is typically the top level of your application, and `index.js` is the entry point.

## Import reactdom

Import React DOM (React 18+ entry):

~~~
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
~~~

- The methods imported from `'react-dom'` interact with the **DOM**.
- The methods imported from `'react'` do **not** deal with the DOM directly.
- The DOM is used in React applications, but it isn’t part of React itself.

`ReactDOM` deals with DOM-specific methods that should be used in `index.js`, the entry point of your application.

## Function component

It’s useful to think of components as smaller pieces of our interface. Combined, they are the building blocks that make up a React application. In a website, we can create a component for the search bar, another component for the navigation bar, and another component for the dashboard content itself. We can use JavaScript functions to define a new React component—this is called a **function component**.

~~~
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return <h1>Hello, I'm a functional React Component!</h1>;
}

export default MyComponent;
~~~

Function component names must start with a capital letter and are conventionally written in **PascalCase**. If a component begins with a lowercase letter, React will try to render a built-in HTML tag (like `div` or `input`) instead.

Components are reusable. Keep them organized by placing each component in its own file and exporting it:

~~~
export default MyComponent;
~~~

Then import it where needed, e.g., from `index.js`:

~~~
import MyComponent from './App';
~~~

> **Tip:** If you need a refresher on `export` and `import`, see the MDN Web Docs.

## Using and rendering a component

Use a component with an HTML-like syntax:

~~~
<MyComponent />
~~~

If you need to nest other components:

~~~
<MyComponent>
  <OtherComponent />
</MyComponent>
~~~

To render to the browser, create a React root and call `.render()` (usually once, in `index.js`):

~~~
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import MyComponent from './App';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('app')).render(<MyComponent />);
~~~

- `document.getElementById('app')` comes from `index.html`.
- `.createRoot()` creates a React root for that element.
- `.render()` mounts your component tree.

> **Note:** In a React app, you typically call `createRoot(...).render(...)` exactly once. After that, React manages the DOM for you.

## Use multiline jsx in a component

A multi-line JSX expression should be wrapped in parentheses:

~~~
import React from 'react';

function QuoteMaker() {
  return (
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The world is full of objects, more or less interesting; I do not wish to add any more.
      </p>
      <cite>
        <a target="_blank"
           href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Huebler">
          Douglas Huebler
        </a>
      </cite>
    </blockquote>
  );
}

export default QuoteMaker;
~~~

## Use a variable attribute in a component

~~~
import React from 'react';

const redPanda = {
  src: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Endangered_Red_Panda.jpg',
  alt: 'Red Panda',
  width: '200px'
};

function RedPanda() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Cute Red Panda</h1>
      <img
        src={redPanda.src}
        alt={redPanda.alt}
        width={redPanda.width}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default RedPanda;
~~~

> **Tip:** In JSX, attributes are JavaScript expressions—wrap them in `{}` when pulling from variables.

## Putting logic in a function component

~~~
function RandomNumber() {
  // First, some logic that must happen before returning
  const n = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
  // Next, a return statement using that logic
  return <h1>{n}</h1>;
}
~~~

## Use a conditional in a function component

~~~
import React from 'react';

function TodaysPlan() {
  let task;
  const apocalypse = false;

  if (!apocalypse) {
    task = 'learn React.js';
  } else {
    task = 'run around';
  }

  return <h1>Today I am going to {task}!</h1>;
}

export default TodaysPlan;
~~~

> **Note:** You can also use the ternary operator or logical `&&` for inline conditionals in JSX.

## Event listener and event handlers in a component

~~~
function MyComponent() {
  function handleHover() {
    alert('Stop it.  Stop hovering.');
  }
  return <div onHover={handleHover}></div>;
}
~~~

> **Attention:** `onHover` is **not** a React DOM event. Use `onMouseEnter` (fires once when the pointer enters) or `onMouseOver` (bubbles) instead:
>
> ~~~
> function MyComponent() {
>   function handleMouseEnter() {
>     alert('Stop it. Stop hovering.');
>   }
>   return <div onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}>Hover me</div>;
> }
> ~~~

Event handler functions are typically defined inside the component and named with the `handle*` convention. Pass the function **reference** (no parentheses) so it runs only when the event occurs.

## Returning another component

~~~
function PurchaseButton() {
  return <button onClick={() => { alert("Purchase Complete"); }}>Purchase</button>;
}

function ItemBox() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>50% Sale</h1>
      <h2>Item: Small Shirt</h2>
      <PurchaseButton />
    </div>
  );
}
~~~

## Apply a component in a render function

We can treat the `Button` component as a child of the parent `App` component. By extracting smaller components, we can reuse these parts.

~~~
import Button from './Button';

function App() {
  return <Button />;
}

export default App;
~~~
