# Introduction to vps

A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is a slice of a physical machine that behaves like a dedicated server. The provider uses a hypervisor (e.g., KVM) to carve one host into isolated virtual machines, each with its own CPU/RAM allocation, disk, operating system, root access, and network identity. You get more control and consistency than shared hosting, without paying for a full dedicated box.

**When to use a VPS**
- You’ve outgrown shared hosting (need custom runtimes, background workers, or predictable performance).
- You want root access to install system packages, tweak firewalls, or run containers.
- You need an affordable, always-on environment for APIs, bots, staging, CI runners, or game servers.

**Common components**
- **Compute:** vCPU count and clock performance matter for dynamic apps and build tasks.
- **Memory:** determines how many processes/containers you can run comfortably.
- **Storage:** SSD/NVMe size and IOPS for databases and logs.
- **Network:** bandwidth caps, egress costs, and regional latency.

**Pros**
- Full control (root, custom OS images).
- Better isolation and consistent resources vs. shared hosting.
- Scales vertically (resize plan) and horizontally (add nodes or load balancer).

**Cons**
- You manage security, updates, and backups (unless you choose a managed tier).
- Misconfiguration can lead to downtime or vulnerabilities.
- Performance depends on plan sizing and host contention.

**Typical stacks**
- LEMP/LAMP (Nginx/Apache + PHP + MySQL/MariaDB)
- Node.js, Python (Gunicorn/Uvicorn) behind Nginx/HAProxy/Caddy
- Containers (Docker/Podman) or lightweight orchestration (Docker Compose, Nomad, k3s)

**Sizing quick tips**
- Static site + small API: 1–2 vCPU, 1–2 GB RAM, 20–40 GB SSD.
- Medium web app + DB: 2–4 vCPU, 4–8 GB RAM, 80–160 GB NVMe (consider separate DB node).
- CPU-bound or build tasks: favor higher single-core performance.

**Security basics**
- Create a non-root sudo user, disable password SSH, enable key-based auth (and optionally FIDO2).
- Keep OS and packages updated; enable unattended upgrades if appropriate.
- Use a firewall (ufw/iptables/nftables), fail2ban, and minimal open ports.
- Backups and snapshots: test restore regularly.

**Cost awareness**
- You usually pay per month (or hour) for the plan size, plus optional storage, snapshots, floating IPs, and bandwidth overage. Monitor egress if you serve large assets.

**Operational checklist**
- Provision → harden → deploy → monitor → back up → document.
- Add observability: metrics (node exporter), logs (journald/filebeat), and alerts (health checks).

**Mental model**

> Tip: If you prefer less ops, pick a managed database and object storage so your VPS only runs your app and reverse proxy.

This guide will walk through practical VPS tasks—from provisioning and hardening to deploying apps and debugging performance—using clear examples and optional playgrounds where interactive visuals help the most.
