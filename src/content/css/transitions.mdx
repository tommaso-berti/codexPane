# Transitions

CSS transitions control the timing of visual state changes. You can configure:
- which properties transition
- how long they last (duration)
- how long to wait before starting (delay)
- how the speed changes over time (timing function)

> **Note**
> Duration and delay are time values (`s` or `ms`). If you provide any time in the shorthand, the **first** one is always treated as **duration**.

## Duration

To create a transition you must set **at least** the property and the duration.

~~~css
a {
  background-color: green;
  font-size: 22px;

  /* multiple properties, one duration */
  transition-property: background-color, font-size;
  transition-duration: 1s;
}

a:hover {
  background-color: red;
  font-size: 32px;
}
~~~

In this example the background starts green at `22px`. On hover it transitions to red at `32px` over **1s**.

> **Tip**
> Valid time units: `3s`, `0.75s`, `500ms`. The default duration is `0s` (instantaneous).

## Timing function

Controls the pace of the transition.

Common values:
- `ease` (default) — slow → fast → slow
- `ease-in` — slow start, fast end
- `ease-out` — fast start, slow end
- `ease-in-out` — slow → fast → slow
- `linear` — constant speed

~~~css
.button {
  transition-property: color;
  transition-duration: 1s;
  transition-timing-function: ease-out;
}
~~~

Here the text color animates for one second, starting quickly and slowing down at the end.

## Delay

Wait before starting the transition. Default is `0s`.

~~~css
.notice {
  transition-property: color;
  transition-duration: 1s;
  transition-timing-function: ease-out;
  transition-delay: 400ms;
}
~~~

## Transition

Use the shorthand to set **property**, **duration**, **timing function**, and **delay** (in that order).

~~~css
.card {
  transition: color 1.5s linear 0.5s;
}
~~~

> **Attention**
> If you include times, the first time value is **duration** and the second is **delay**.

## Combination

Multiple transitions can be comma-separated:

~~~css
.tile {
  transition: color 1s linear, font-size 750ms ease-in 100ms;
}
~~~

## All

Apply the same timing to all animatable properties:

~~~css
.panel {
  transition: all 1.5s linear 0.5s;
}
~~~

> **Note**
> Not every property is animatable. See MDN’s list:
> [CSS properties that can be transitioned](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties)

## Animation tips

**Slide-down and fade-in effect**

This rule makes the element slide down from above and fade in when hovered over.

~~~css
.element {
    position: fixed; /* or absolute, depending on your layout */
    op: -100%; /* Start position above the visible area */
    opacity: 0; /* Start fully transparent */
    transition: top 0.5s ease-out, opacity 0.3s linear; /* Transition properties */
}

.element:hover {
    top: 0; /* Move into view */
    opacity: 1; /* Fully visible */
}
~~~
