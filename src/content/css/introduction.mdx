# Introduction to CSS

CSS (**Cascading Style Sheets**) is the language used to style and layout web pages. Introduced by the W3C in 1996, CSS was created to separate content from presentation, allowing developers to control the look and feel of websites independently from their HTML structure. Over the years, CSS has evolved with new features and modules, enabling responsive design, animations, and advanced visual effects. Today, CSS is an essential technology for building modern, accessible, and visually engaging web experiences.
