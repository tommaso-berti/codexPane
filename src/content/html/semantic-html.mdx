# Semantic Html

By using **semantic HTML**, we choose elements for their **meaning**, not their presentation. Elements like `<div>` and `<span>` are non-semantic—they give no context. Using `<header>` instead of a generic `<div>` clarifies intent and structure.

## Why Use Semantic Html

- **Accessibility**: Screen readers and browsers can better interpret content.
- **SEO**: Search engines can identify and prioritize important content.
- **Easy To Understand**: Source code is clearer for developers.

## Header

A container for introductory content or navigation, often containing `<h1>`–`<h6>`.

~~~html
<header>
  <h1>Site Title</h1>
  <!-- optional nav here -->
</header>
~~~

## Nav

Defines a block of navigation links (menus, tables of contents). Can be inside `<header>` or standalone.

~~~html
<nav>
  <a href="/">Home</a>
  <a href="/articles">Articles</a>
  <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
</nav>
~~~

## Main

Encapsulates the **dominant** content of a page (separate from `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>`).

~~~html
<main>
  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>This is the primary content.</p>
</main>
~~~

## Footer

Appears at the bottom with meta information.

Common items:
- Contact information
- Copyright
- Terms of use
- Sitemap
- Back to top links

~~~html
<footer>
  <p>© 2025 My Company · <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
</footer>
~~~

## Section

Groups related content (a chapter, topic, or thematic block).

~~~html
<section>
  <h2>Cricket News</h2>
  <article>Latest match analysis…</article>
</section>
~~~

## Article

Holds content that stands on its own (post, comment, magazine entry).

~~~html
<article>
  <h2>Match Recap</h2>
  <p>The first World Series was played in 1903…</p>
</article>
~~~

## Aside

Supplementary content that enhances but isn’t essential to the main flow.

Common uses: bibliographies, endnotes, comments, pull quotes, sidebars, additional info.

~~~html
<article>
  <p>The first World Series was played between Pittsburgh and Boston in 1903…</p>
</article>
<aside>
  <p>Babe Ruth once stated, “Heroes get remembered, but legends never die.”</p>
</aside>
~~~

## Figure

Wraps self-contained media referenced in the document.

~~~html
<figure>
  <img src="overwatch.jpg" alt="Overwatch characters">
</figure>
~~~

## Figcaption

Describes media in a `<figure>`. Stays associated even if the figure is moved.

~~~html
<figure>
  <img src="overwatch.jpg" alt="Overwatch characters">
  <figcaption>This picture shows characters from Overwatch.</figcaption>
</figure>
~~~

## Audio

Embeds audio content. Use `controls`; include a `source` with `type` for better support.

~~~html
<audio controls>
  <source src="iAmAnAudioFile.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
