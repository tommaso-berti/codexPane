# Digital Accessibility

Accessibility is designing devices, products, and environments so people with disabilities or sensory impairments can use them. On the web, follow **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1** to build inclusive experiences.

Common examples:
- Screen readers parsing content for visually impaired users.
- Closed captions for videos.
- Images with descriptive `alt` text.
- Full keyboard navigation (e.g., using **Tab**).

> Note: Accessibility benefits everyone—clear structure, sensible focus order, and readable text improve overall UX.

## Contrast

Contrast helps users scan and understand hierarchy. Apply contrast thoughtfully across:
- **Headings** (size and weight)
- **Font choices** (clarity and weight)
- **Color** (foreground vs background)

> Tip: Ensure interactive elements (links, buttons) have sufficient contrast in all states (default, hover, focus, disabled).

## Headings

There are six levels, `<h1>`–`<h6>`, decreasing in priority.
- Create structure and visual contrast.
- Provide landmarks for assistive tech.
- Each page should have **one `<h1>`** describing the page purpose.
- Do not skip levels (e.g., avoid jumping from `h1` to `h3`).

> Attention: Keywords in `<h1>` often carry more SEO weight than in body text.

## Font Accessibility

Prefer **real text** over images of text:
- Readable by screen readers.
- Scales cleanly and loads faster.
- Choose high-contrast text with legible sizes.

**Contrasting colors**
Check color pairs for WCAG compliance (normal text ≥ **4.5:1**, large text ≥ **3:1**).

**Font sizes**
Default browser text is ~16px. Use smaller sizes sparingly for nonessential content.

## Color Accessibility

Black on white maximizes contrast but can cause glare for some users. Consider:
- Choose colors with strong **luminance** separation.
- Support **color vision deficiencies** (red–green is most common).
- Use multiple cues (text, icons) rather than color alone.

Practical steps:
- Pick highly contrasting colors (often opposite on a color wheel).
- Use multiple shades of a color to maintain contrast (think grayscale).
- Pair color with text or icons for state and error messages.

> Note: Toptal’s color-blind filter can preview designs under different deficiencies.

## Best Practices

**Text over images**
Add a dark (or light) overlay behind text to meet contrast ratios.

**Do not remove input labels**
Placeholders are low-contrast and not a replacement for visible labels.

**Buttons and links**
Minimalism should not hide clickability. Use visible affordances and don’t rely on color alone.

## Semantic Html Elements

Use meaningful tags so assistive tech understands structure:
- Wrap site navigation in `<header>` or `<nav>`, not a generic `<div class="header">`.

## Aria Role

ARIA adds semantics where native HTML is insufficient.

Some roles: `button`, `navigation`, `main`, `complementary`, `presentation`.

**Complementary example**
~~~html
<div id="code-editor" role="complementary">
  ...
</div>
~~~

**Presentation example**
~~~html
<ol role="presentation">
  <li>List Item 1</li>
  <li>List Item 2</li>
</ol>

<div id="container" role="presentation">
  <p>I'm content you want to hear!</p>
</div>
~~~

> Tip: Prefer native elements first (`<button>` over `role="button"`). Use ARIA to fill gaps, not replace semantics.

## Aria Properties

`aria-label` provides accessible names for elements.

~~~html
<img src="#" alt="A painting of the Shenandoah Valley" />
<p aria-label="Artist">Armand Cabrera, 2010</p>
~~~

> Note: Use `aria-label` for elements that don’t support `alt`. Do not duplicate visible text with `aria-label` unless necessary.

## Alt Attribute

Describe images concisely for non-visual contexts.

~~~html
<img src="#" alt="a kitten snuggling a puppy" />
~~~

Guidelines:
- Keep it concise and relevant to purpose.
- If the image is a link, describe the **destination**.
- Decorative images: use empty `alt=""`.
- Do not duplicate nearby captions; use empty `alt` instead.
- Aim for ≤ 150 characters.

## Screen Readers

Screen readers convert on-screen text to speech or braille.

- **VoiceOver** (macOS): toggle with `Command`+`F5`.
- **NVDA** (Windows): free, widely used.
- **ChromeVox** (Chrome): built with web technologies and ARIA support.

> Tip: Test keyboard-only navigation and screen reader output for critical flows.
