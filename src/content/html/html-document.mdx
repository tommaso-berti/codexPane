# HTML Document

## Doctype

This declaration is an instruction that **must be the first line** of your HTML document. It tells the browser what type of document to expect and which version of HTML is being used. Today, the `html` in `<!DOCTYPE html>` refers to **HTML5**, the current standard.

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

</html>
~~~

> Note: The doctype isn’t an HTML element; it’s a declaration for the browser and parsers.

## Website Common Document Hierarchy

When making multi-page static websites, developers often store HTML files in the **root directory**, a main folder containing all project files. As your projects grow, add subfolders to organize code and assets.

~~~text
project-folder/
|—— about.html
|—— contact.html
|—— index.html
~~~

> Tip: Keep asset folders like `css/`, `js/`, and `images/` at the project root for predictable relative paths.

## Document Structure

~~~html
<html></html>
~~~
The first tag in an HTML file. Everything inside is HTML content.

~~~html
<head></head>
~~~
Contains **metadata** about the page (not rendered visually). Typical contents include `<meta>` tags, styles, and the document `<title>`.

~~~html
<title></title>
~~~
Defines the text shown in the browser tab. The `<title>` is **always inside** `<head>`.

~~~html
<body></body>
~~~
Contains the **main content** of the page that is rendered to users.

~~~html
<footer></footer>
~~~
Contains the **footer** of the page—often site credits, links, or legal text.

## Elements Overview

~~~html
<section></section>
~~~
The `<section>` element defines a **thematic grouping of content**, typically with a heading. It signals that enclosed content is related and forms a distinct section.

> Note: Use `<section>` for **semantically meaningful** groupings. Use `<div>` for **generic containers** when no specific semantic element fits.

~~~html
<!-- Minimal semantic skeleton example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <section>
      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>Hello world.</p>
    </section>
    <footer>© 2025</footer>
  </body>
</html>
