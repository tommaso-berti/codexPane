# Commands

## Show databases
To see all databases inside a cluster:

~~~mongosh
show dbs
~~~

This outputs a list of databases in the current instance with approximate disk usage, for example:

~~~
online_plant_shop       73.7 KiB
plant_lovers_meet       55.7 MiB
my_portfolio_site       9.57 MiB
admin                   340 KiB
local                   1.37 GiB
config                  12.00 KiB
~~~

> Note: `admin`, `config`, and `local` are system databases used by MongoDB to manage and configure the instance.

## Switch database
Navigate to a particular database:

~~~mongosh
use <database_name>
~~~

Example:

~~~mongosh
use online_plant_shop
~~~

This places you inside the `online_plant_shop` database, where you can view and manage its collections.

> Tip: The prompt shows the current database before the `>` symbol. After switching, you should see it change, e.g., `test>` â†’ `online_plant_shop>`.

## Database creation behavior
If the database you specify does not exist, MongoDB will create it **lazily** (on first write) and place you into that context immediately after `use`.

## Current database
If you lose track of your context, print the current database name:

~~~mongosh
db
~~~

This outputs the name of the database you are currently using.

## Show collections
List all collections in the current database:

~~~mongosh
show collections
~~~
