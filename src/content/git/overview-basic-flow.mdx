# Overview basic flow

Git is the industry-standard version control system for web developers.

> **Note**
> Some repositories default to a branch named `main` instead of `master`. Outputs may vary slightly by Git version and environment.

## Initialize a repository

Create a new repository in the current folder:

~~~bash
git init
~~~

**Response**

~~~text
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/ccuser/workspace/manhattan-zoo-1/.git/
~~~

## Check changes

View current local modifications and tracking status:

~~~bash
git status
~~~

**Response**

~~~text
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        scene-1.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~~~

## Stage files

Add files to the staging area so Git can include them in the next commit:

~~~bash
git add filename_you_are_editing                 # single file
git add filename_you_are_editing other_filename  # multiple files
git add .                                        # all modified files in the folder
~~~

Check status again:

~~~bash
git status
~~~

**Response**

~~~text
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   scene-1.txt
~~~

> **Tip**
> To unstage a file: `git restore --staged <file>` (or `git reset HEAD <file>` on older Git).

## View differences

See differences between the working directory and the staging area:

~~~bash
git diff
~~~

**Response**

~~~diff
diff --git a/scene-1.txt b/scene-1.txt
index c33ce4c..1e73963 100644
--- a/scene-1.txt
+++ b/scene-1.txt

+Dumblediff: I should've known you would be here, Professor McGonagit.
\ No newline at end of file
~~~

> **Tip**
> `git diff --staged` (or `--cached`) shows differences between the **staging area** and the **last commit**.

## Commit changes

A commit permanently stores changes from the staging area inside the repository. `-m` adds a commit message.

Standard conventions for commit messages:
- Must be in quotation marks
- Written in the present tense
- Should be brief (≈50 characters or less) when using `-m`

Create the commit:

~~~bash
git commit -m "Complete first line of dialogue"
~~~

**Response**

~~~text
[master (root-commit) a659c51] Prima riga di codice fatta
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 scene-1.txt
~~~

> **Note**
> Your commit ID (SHA), author, and message will differ based on your setup.

## View history

Commits are stored chronologically and can be viewed with:

~~~bash
git log
~~~

**Response**

~~~text
commit a659c518f418547ce82b4557a86ffcee61ee33f4
Author: codecademy <ccuser@codecademy.com>
Date:   Sun Oct 27 22:00:38 2024 +0000

    Prima riga di codice fatta
~~~

**Output, notice:**
- A 40-character code (SHA) that uniquely identifies the commit
- The commit author (you!)
- The date and time of the commit
- The commit message

> **Tip**
> Press `q` to exit the log pager. Use `git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all` for a compact view of history.
