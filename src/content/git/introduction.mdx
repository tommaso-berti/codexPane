# Introduction to Git

Git is a **distributed version control system**. It tracks changes to your files, lets you create branches to experiment safely, and enables collaboration through platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

## Why Git

- Work offline with a full local history.
- Create lightweight branches for features and fixes.
- Merge changes and resolve conflicts with clear history.
- Collaborate via pull requests and code review.

## Core Concepts

- **Repository (repo):** A project folder tracked by Git.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of changes with a message.
- **Branch:** A movable pointer to a line of commits (e.g., `main`, `feature/login`).
- **Remote:** A shared copy of the repo (e.g., `origin` on GitHub).
- **Staging area (index):** Where you prepare changes before committing.

## Essential Commands

Initialize and inspect:
~~~
git init
git status
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
~~~

Stage and commit:
~~~
git add .          # stage all changes
git commit -m "Explain what changed"
~~~

Branch and merge:
~~~
git switch -c feature/search   # create and switch
git switch main
git merge feature/search       # merge into main
~~~

Sync with a remote:
~~~
git remote add origin https://example.com/you/repo.git
git push -u origin main
git pull --rebase               # fetch + replay your commits
~~~

Undo safely:
~~~
git restore --staged <file>     # unstage
git restore <file>              # discard unstaged changes
git revert <commit>             # new commit that undoes another
~~~

## Typical Workflow

1. Update your local `main`: `git switch main && git pull`.
2. Create a feature branch: `git switch -c feature/my-change`.
3. Commit small, focused changes with clear messages.
4. Push and open a pull request for review.
5. Merge back to `main` after approvals and CI passes.

> Tip: Prefer **rebasing** your feature branch onto `main` to keep history linear; prefer **merge commits** when you need to preserve a detailed integration history.

## Next Steps

- Learn branching strategies (Git Flow, Trunk Based).
- Practice resolving merge conflicts.
- Explore interactive staging and rebasing.
- Set up hooks and CI to automate checks.

> Note: Always write descriptive commit messages—think “subject line” (imperative mood) plus a short body when needed. This makes history useful for future you.
