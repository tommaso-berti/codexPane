# File Manipulation

## Create files
The `touch` command creates a new file inside the working directory.
~~~bash
$ touch keyboard.txt
~~~

## View file contents
The `cat` command outputs in the terminal the contents of a specified file.
~~~bash
cat hello_cli.txt
~~~

## Create file with content
Create a new file named `hello_cli.txt` and add `Hello Command Line` to that file.
~~~bash
echo "Hello Command Line" >> hello_cli.txt
~~~
> Tip: `>>` appends to a file (creates it if missing). Use `>` to overwrite instead.

## Copy files
Make a copy of a file.
~~~bash
cp source.txt destination.bak
~~~
> Note: The `.bak` file extension is commonly used to notate a file as a backup of a file with the same name.

## Copy and rename
If we wanted to rename the file as well, we would include the name in the path of the second argument.
~~~bash
cp the-office.txt slapstick/the-office-us.txt
# or
cp biopic/cleopatra.txt historical/cleopatra.txtx
~~~
> Attention: The extension `cleopatra.txtx` looks intentional here; if it was a typo, use `.txt`.

## Copy multiple files
Copy multiple file to a directory.
~~~bash
cp file1.txt folder/file2.txt my_directory
~~~

For example, copy all files in the current working directory into another directory.
~~~bash
cp * my_directory
~~~

## Copy with wildcards
To move just the “.txt” files you can use a wildcard with a suffix:
~~~bash
cp *.txt my_directory
~~~

In addition to suffixes, prefix text can be used with wildcards. Using `w*.txt` selects all files in the working directory starting with “w” (prefix) and ending with “.txt” (suffix), and copies them to `my_directory/`.
~~~bash
cp w*.txt my_directory
~~~

## Move files
`mv` moves files from a directory to another (very similar to `cp`).
~~~bash
mv my_file.txt my_directory/
~~~

## Current directory dot
The dot (`.`) is the current directory.
~~~bash
mv my_file.txt .
~~~

## Remove files
The `rm` command deletes files and directories. Without `-r` it deletes only files.
~~~bash
rm unwanted_file.txt
~~~

## Remove directories recursively
The `-r` (recursive) option is used to delete a directory and all of its child directories.
~~~bash
rm -r unwanted_directory
~~~
> Attention: `rm -r` is destructive. Consider adding `-i` (interactive) or double-checking the path before running.
