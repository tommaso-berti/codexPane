# Environment (nano text editor)

## Nano
~~~bash
$ nano hello.txt
~~~
`nano` is a command line text editor. It works like desktop editors (TextEdit/Notepad) but is keyboard-driven.

- `nano hello.txt` opens (or creates) `hello.txt`.
- Type your text (e.g., `Hello, I am nano`) where the cursor is.
- Use the on-screen shortcuts to save and exit.

> Tip: Common shortcuts — **Ctrl+O** write out (save), **Enter** confirm, **Ctrl+X** exit, **Ctrl+W** search.

## Bash profile
A bash profile stores environment settings for your terminal (commonly `~/.bash_profile`).

Activate changes for the current session:
~~~bash
$ source .bash_profile
~~~

Absolute path:
~~~bash
~/.bash_profile
~~~
> Note: If it does not exist, create it (e.g., `touch ~/.bash_profile`).

## Alias
Create keyboard shortcuts for commands:
~~~bash
alias pd="pwd"
~~~
- No spaces around `=`.
- Add the alias line to `~/.bash_profile` to persist across sessions, then:
~~~bash
$ source .bash_profile
~~~

## Environment variables
Environment variables hold environment info and can be shared with child processes.
~~~bash
export USER="Jane Doe"
echo $USER
~~~
- `USER="Jane Doe"` sets the variable for the current shell.
- `export` makes it available to child sessions.
- Use `$VAR` to read a value.

## PS1
`PS1` controls the prompt appearance. Include a trailing space for readability.
~~~bash
export PS1=">> "
# After sourcing, the prompt changes:
>>
~~~
> Tip: Add to `~/.bash_profile` and `source` it to apply immediately.

## Home
`HOME` is the home directory path:
~~~bash
$ echo $HOME
~~~
You can set it if needed, but typically it’s managed by the system.

## Path
`PATH` lists directories (colon-separated) where executables are searched.
~~~bash
$ echo $PATH
/home/ccuser/.gem/ruby/2.0.0/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/bin
~~~
Each directory contains executable scripts/binaries.

Examples:
~~~bash
/bin/pwd
/bin/ls

$ /bin/pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/path-variable

$ pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/path-variable
~~~

## Env
`env` prints environment variables for the current user (e.g., `PATH`, `PWD`, `PS1`, `HOME`).
Filter a specific variable:
~~~bash
env | grep PATH
~~~
> Tip: Combine with `sort`/`uniq` for readable listings, or `printenv VAR` to show a single value.
