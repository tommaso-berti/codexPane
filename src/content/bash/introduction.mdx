# Introduction to bash

Bash (the **Bourne Again SHell**) is a command-line interpreter and scripting language used on Linux, macOS, WSL, and many Unix-like systems. It lets you execute programs, chain commands, automate repetitive tasks, and glue together tools using pipes and redirection. If you can type it, you can probably script it.

**What makes Bash useful**
- **Interactive shell:** run commands, navigate files, manage processes.
- **Scripting language:** variables, conditionals, loops, functions—write repeatable automation.
- **Composability:** small utilities + pipes (`|`) + redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`) = powerful workflows.
- **Portability:** scripts often run unchanged across many systems.

**Core ideas, fast**
- **Commands and args:** `grep -i "error" /var/log/syslog`
- **Pipes:** output of one command becomes input to the next
~~~bash
ps aux | grep node | awk '{print $2}'
  ~~~
- **Redirection:** send output to files or read from files
~~~bash
echo "hello" > hello.txt
sort < input.txt > output.txt
  ~~~
- **Globbing:** match files with wildcards
~~~bash
rm *.log
  ~~~
- **Variables:** store and reuse values
~~~bash
NAME="Ada"
echo "Hi, $NAME"
  ~~~
- **Command substitution:** capture output
~~~bash
TODAY=$(date +%F)
echo "Backup-$TODAY.tar.gz"
  ~~~
- **Exit status & control:**
~~~bash
make || echo "Build failed"
  ~~~

> **Tip:** Use `set -euo pipefail` at the top of scripts to catch errors early and make failures explicit.

**A tiny script example**
~~~bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

SRC_DIR=${1:-"src"}
DEST="archive-$(date +%F).tar.gz"

tar -czf "$DEST" "$SRC_DIR"
echo "Created $DEST"
~~~

**Learning path**
1. Get comfortable with navigation (`cd`, `ls`, `pwd`) and file ops (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `cat`, `less`).
2. Practice pipes and filters (`grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`).
3. Write small scripts with arguments, loops, and conditionals.
4. Learn quoting rules (single vs double vs no quotes) and escaping.
5. Explore functions, arrays, and traps for robust automation.

> **Note:** Bash has sharp edges—quoting and word splitting can surprise you. Test interactively, then script.

With these fundamentals, you can turn ad-hoc terminal work into reliable, shareable automation.
