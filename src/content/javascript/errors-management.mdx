# Errors management

Understand common error types, how to **throw** them intentionally, and how to **handle** them using `try...catch`.

## Error stack traces

When an error occurs, JavaScript prints a **stack trace** that shows where execution moved through your code before the error happened. Read it **top-to-bottom** to locate the first line of your code that triggered the issue.

> **Tip**
> In browsers, open DevTools → Console to see the error message, file, and line number.

## Error types

- **SyntaxError** — Invalid code that the engine cannot parse (unmatched brackets, stray characters, etc.).
- **ReferenceError** — Using a variable that hasn’t been declared.
- **TypeError** — Performing an operation on a value of the wrong type (e.g., calling a string method on a number).

~~~js
// Examples
// SyntaxError: Unclosed parenthesis
// console.log("hi";

// ReferenceError: foo is not defined
// console.log(foo);

// TypeError: (123).toUpperCase is not a function
// (123).toUpperCase();
~~~

## Throw errors

Creating an error object doesn’t stop execution; **throwing** it does.

~~~js
throw Error('Something wrong happened');
// Error: Something wrong happened
~~~

> **Note**
> You can throw custom error types: `throw new TypeError('Expected a string');`

## Try catch

Handle failures without crashing the program using `try...catch` (and optionally `finally`).

~~~js
try {
  throw Error('This error will get caught');
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e); // handle or log the error
} finally {
  // runs whether try succeeded or threw
}
console.log('The thrown error that was caught in the try...catch statement!');
~~~

> **Tip**
> Keep `try` blocks **small** and handle only the code that may throw. Surface actionable messages to users; log details for developers.
