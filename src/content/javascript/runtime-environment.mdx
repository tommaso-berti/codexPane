# Runtime Environment

## Browser console
Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript (JS) is one of the core languages in web development. Beyond embedding code in an HTML `<script>` tag, modern browsers include a **console** in their developer tools where you can type and run JS directly. The console is a REPL (Read–Evaluate–Print–Loop) with access to the current page, allowing you to:
- run ad-hoc JS for testing and debugging,
- inspect or modify the **DOM**,
- view logs, network activity, and security errors.

> **Tip:** Run `clear()` first to clear the console.

~~~js
// Try in your browser DevTools console:
console.log("Hello from the console!");
document.body.style.background = "lavender";
~~~

## What is a runtime environment
A **runtime environment** is where your program executes. It defines:
- which **global objects** and APIs you can access,
- how your code is scheduled and run,
- available capabilities (e.g., DOM vs. filesystem).

This guide covers two JS runtime environments: the **browser** and **Node**.

## A browsers runtime environment
The browser is the most common place JavaScript runs. Any program executed here has access to browser-specific globals like `window`, the DOM, and Web APIs.

Example: create and open a local HTML file.

~~~html
<!-- my_website.html -->
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My Website</h1>
    <script>
      window.alert("Hello World");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

Open it in your browser (e.g., File → Open File → `my_website.html`). When the page loads, the embedded `<script>` executes and `window.alert()` shows a pop-up. The `window` object exposes lots of browser data and functionality beyond `.alert()`—including the DOM, timers, storage, fetch, and more.

> **Note:** Applications executed in the browser are **front-end** apps.

## Node runtime environment
Created in 2009, **Node** lets you execute JavaScript **outside** the browser, enabling full-stack JS. Browser-only globals like `window.alert()` are unavailable; instead, Node provides server-side capabilities such as filesystem, networking, and process information.

~~~js
// my-app.js
console.log(process.env.PWD);
~~~

`process` contains data about the running program. `process.env` gives you environment variables like `PWD` (Print Working Directory).

Run the file with Node:

~~~bash
node my-app.js
# → /path/to/working/directory
~~~

Open the Node REPL (interactive shell):

~~~bash
node
> process.env.HOME
'/home/ccuser'
~~~

> **Attention:** Choose your runtime based on the APIs you need. Use the browser for DOM/Web APIs; use Node for server-side tasks such as file I/O, networking, or scripts.
