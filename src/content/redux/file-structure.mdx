 File structure

## Ducks pattern structure
Instead, it is more common, and better practice, to break up a Redux application using the Redux Ducks pattern, like so:
~~~
src/
|-- index.js
|-- app/
    |-- store.js
|-- features/
    |-- featureA/
        |-- featureASlice.js
    |-- featureB/
        |-- featureBSlice.js
~~~

* The entry point for the entire application, `index.js`
* The sub-directories `app/` and `features/`.
* The `src/app/` directory has only one file (for now), `store.js`. As before, the ultimate purpose of this file is to create the `rootReducer` and the Redux `store`.
* The `src/features/` directory, and its own `src/features/featureX/` sub-directories, contain all of the code relating to each individual slice of the store‘s state. For example, for the `state.favoriteRecipes` slice, its slice reducer and action creators can be found in the file called `src/features/favoriteRecipes/favoriteRecipesSlice.js`.

> Tip: Name slice files with the `*Slice.js` suffix to make discovery easier across large codebases.

## App and features directories
At a minimum:
* `app/store.js` exports a configured Redux store (and typically wires the root reducer).
* `features/*` holds each feature’s slice reducer, actions, and tests.

Keeping `app/` focused on setup (store creation, root reducer) and `features/` focused on domain logic improves scalability and boundaries between features.

## React integrated structure
More complex file structures (including React elements):
~~~
src/
|-- index.js
|-- app/
    |-- App.js (+)
    |-- store.js
|-- components/
    |-- FavoriteButton.js (+)
    |-- Recipe.js (+)
|-- features/
    |-- allRecipes/
        |-- AllRecipes.js (+)
        |-- allRecipesSlice.js
    |-- favoriteRecipes/
        |-- FavoriteRecipes.js (+)
        |-- favoriteRecipesSlice.js
    |-- searchTerm/
        |-- SearchTerm.js (+)
        |-- searchTermSlice.js
~~~

* `<App />`: The top-level component for the entire application.
* `<AllRecipes />`: The component for rendering the recipes loaded from the “database”.
* `<FavoriteRecipes />`: The component for rendering the recipes favorited by the user.
* `<SearchTerm />`: The component for rendering the search bar that filters the visible recipes.
* `<Recipe />` and `<FavoriteButton />`: Generic components used by `<AllRecipes />` and `<FavoriteRecipes />`.

## Component colocation with slices
Aside from the generic components, each feature-related React component file is located in the same directory as the slice file that manages the data rendered by that component. For example, `FavoriteRecipes.js` and `favoriteRecipesSlice.js` are both in the `src/features/favoriteRecipes/` directory.

> Note: Co-locating a feature’s UI and state logic reduces cross-folder navigation and keeps refactors local.

## App component responsibilities
Open the `src/app/App.js` file where the top-level component, `<App />`, is stored. As in most React applications, this top-level component will render each feature-component and pass any data needed by those components as prop values. In Redux applications, the data passed to each feature-component includes:
* The slice of the store‘s state to be rendered. For example, the `state.searchTerm` slice is passed to the `<SearchTerm />` component.
* The `store.dispatch` method to trigger state changes through user interactions within the component. For example, the `<SearchTerm />` component will need to dispatch `setSearchTerm()` actions.

> Tip: In React apps using `react-redux`, prefer `<Provider store={store}>` with `useSelector()` and `useDispatch()` inside components instead of drilling props through `<App />`. It achieves the same goals with less boilerplate.

## Index wiring and props
This distribution of the `store.dispatch` method and the slices of state to all of the feature-components, via the `<App />` component, begins in the `index.js` file. Open up the `src/index.js` file where you will see some standard React code for rendering the top-level `<App />` component. You’ll notice that the `store` is missing, and the `<App />` component isn’t receiving any props!

A minimal wiring example:
~~~
/* src/index.js */
import React from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import App from "./app/App";
import store from "./app/store";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>
);
~~~

~~~
/* src/app/store.js */
import { createStore, combineReducers } from "redux";
import favoriteRecipesReducer from "../features/favoriteRecipes/favoriteRecipesSlice";
import allRecipesReducer from "../features/allRecipes/allRecipesSlice";
import searchTermReducer from "../features/searchTerm/searchTermSlice";

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  favoriteRecipes: favoriteRecipesReducer,
  allRecipes: allRecipesReducer,
  searchTerm: searchTermReducer
});

const store = createStore(rootReducer);
export default store;
~~~

> Attention: If you are using Redux Toolkit, `configureStore({ reducer })` replaces `createStore()` and adds sensible defaults.
